STRUGGLE STAGE (“BEFORE”)
Current Reality for Branding and Marketing Agencies
Time-Consuming Proposal Processes: Agencies invest significant time in responding to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). On average, teams spend 25 hours crafting a single RFP response. ​loopio.com
High Rejection Rates and Resource Drain: The RFP process can be inefficient, with many agencies experiencing low win rates despite substantial time investments. This inefficiency leads to wasted resources and missed opportunities. ​openasset.com+1loopio.com+1
Fragmented Tools Hindering Efficiency: Designers often juggle multiple platforms such as Figma, Photoshop, Canva, and Midjourney, leading to inefficiencies and increased chances of errors.​
Burnout from After-Hours Work: Proposal professionals frequently work beyond standard hours, with 62% working more than 40 hours per week on proposals, contributing to employee burnout and reduced productivity. ​responsive.io
Cash Flow Instability Due to Late Payments: Delayed payments are a significant issue, with 80% of small firms experiencing payment-related challenges. Such delays disrupt cash flow, hindering agencies’ ability to manage operational expenses effectively. ​gatewaycfs.com
